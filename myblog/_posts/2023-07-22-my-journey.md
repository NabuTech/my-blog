# My Journey in Software Development: Novice to Graduate

## Epigraph
" Home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to tread through shadows to the edge of night, until the stars are all alight. Then the world behind and home ahead, we'll wander back to home and bed. Mist and twilight, cloud and shade, away shall fade! Away shall fade!"
    - J.R.R Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers


## Introduction
My Journey was not a fantastical adventue through Middle-Earth but a rather a transformative voyage through the vast landscape of technology, as I pursued my path to becoming a software developer. This is my personal story, devoid of orcs, evil wizards, and ghosts, instead navigating the challenges of deciphering diverse languages from HTML to C# (which might as well have been Elvish), overcoming self-doubt, managing time constraints, embracing failure, and conquering the Sauron of my story: procrastination. Join me as I share the highlights, challenges, and milestones of my journey, with the aim of inspiring others who want to take a similar path while reflecting on my own experiences.

## Starting as a Novice:
The catalyst for change came in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which compelled me to seek a new direction after nearly two decades in the hospitality industry. The upheavel of moving countries, coupled with the inability to work, transformed the seeds of doubt about my future in hospitality into a blossoming desire to explore the worlds of of software development. Driven by curiosity and the allure of technology I took a leap of faith and started a diploma in software development.

## Overview: Year One
The early classes in IT Systems and Proffessional Practice laid a solid foundation, introducing key concepts such as computer functionality and personal effectiveness skills. This introduced me to the magical world of Linux, Trello, Miro, and Git, ignited my interest in Automation that would be circular route my journey. Delving into Data Handling and Web Concepts, I gained knowledge of SQL, HTML, and CSS.
Building on this foundation, Programming Principles introduced me to Python and covered essential concepts like data types, functions, loops, and containers. The first year concluded with Business Analysis and Solution Design and Client-Side Deve,lopment, honing my understanding of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and front-end development.

## Overview: Year Two
The second year began with Data Structures and Algorithms, where I explored C# and software design patterns. Mobile App Development followed focusing on Xamarin and mobile optimization. Although a detour in to Game Development was interrupted due to COVID and repeating the term,(the school dropped Game Development for Advanced Mobile Development). Learning Advanced Mobile Development, covered React Native,React and Software Testing and Maintenance, mastering my understanding of Git, and learning testing plans and pythondoc. The course then shifted its focus to teamwork and software development methodologies, with classes in Agile Project Management and Secure Web App Development. Learning Agile methodologies, Kanban, Scrum and Devops, and applying those principles in Secure Web App Development using Django. 
The final classes revolved around Data Access and Management, where I delved deeper into databases, including non-SQL with MongoDB, and more Agile application using project management with Django. Web Services covered a wide range of topics, from Software Architecture to SOAP, RESTful Web Services, API's, Webhooks, Zapier, and designing a music API.The completion of my Final Project was my Mount Doom, but that is a story for another day.

## Challenges and Growth:
Every challenge I faced led to personal growth. From battling overwhelming self-doubt when grappling with new concepts or languages/frameworks, I gradually became more self-confident. I learned to manage my time effectively, overcoming the struggle of juggling various circumstances and deadlines. The ever-changing landscape of topics, languages, and frameworks preseted a significant challenge, as it felt impossible to absorb eberything in such a short period, every re-visit to a topic felt like beginning again. However, over the time nuggets of information I retained cracked open and shed new understanding. The greatest growth was conquering procrastination and overcoming the fear of failure, not building things because of lack of understanding or potential failure is gone. While the early attempts may have been imperfect(or flat out garbage), I learned that practice and building upon previous knowledge are the keys to improvement. Self-Reflection is a huge bonus to learning Software Development, and a good lesson for life.

## Future Aspirations
With the circle now complete, I reflect on my initial assignment in Proffesional Practice, where I chose to explore Automation as an emerging technology. It terrified and intrigued me, as I recognized it as the future. Here we are, two years later, witnessing the explosion of AI. I have learned not to fear change but to embrace it. So, what lies ahead? Well, my passion for learning and self-improvement drives me to continue my studies, pursuing a Bachelors in IT for another year. I am building my online brand, showcasing my skills, developing my own software projects, and sharing my technological explorations while teaching others. Additionally, I am actively seeking employment within the industry to gain valuable experience and further enhance my skills.

## Conclusion
Throughout this journey, I've gained a solid foundation in various languages, frameworks, and methodologies, expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. Beyond the technical skills I have learnt resilience, perserverance and embracing change. To those taking similar steps I encourage you to embrace the challenges. Failure is massively important, because reflecting on what went wrong helps you progress. As I reflect on how far I have come it excites me for the endless possibilities in the ever evolving landscape of technology. You will not learn everything, and even if you concentrate on a specific topic its only a matter of time before it is supplanted by something else whether by iteself evolving or an alternative emerging. Embrace the hunger for knowledge and let your passion guide you. This has been one of the best experiences I have undertaken, to have passion for what you do is the ultimate goal and grateful to find my calling.
